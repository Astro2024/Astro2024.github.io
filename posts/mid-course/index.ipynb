    "*In this section I'll ask you to fill in some data. You don't have to give precise numbers -- approximate, conversational responses are fine. For example, when I ask \"how often have you attended class,\" good answers include \"almost always,\" \"I've missed three times,\" \"about 75% of the time,\" \"not as often as I want,\" etc.* \n",

    "### Presence in Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- *How often have you attended class? \n",

    "- *How often have you taken notes on the core readings ahead of the class period?* ____\n",
    "    - I do not take note on readings before class. In computer science classes I internalize work best when I am actually coding or doing assignments, so I have spent more effort on doing all of the warmup assignements.\n",
    "- *How often have you been **prepared** to present the daily warm-up exercise to your team, even if you weren't actually called?*  \n",
    "    - There have been two classes where I was not prepared present the warmup\n",
    "- *How many times have you **actually** presented the daily warm-up to your team?* \n",
    "    - I believe I have presented 4-5 times (our leader is often gone and we randomize the leader)\n",
    "- *How many times have you asked your team for help while presenting the daily warm-up?* \n",
    "    - Twice, they were the two classes I was not prepared to present. However, both times after discussing with teammates I ended up presenting.\n",
    "- *How often have you learned something new from a teammate's presentation of the daily warm-up?*\n",
    "    - I do not think their presentation to the class has taught me something new, but in our group discussion I think I learn something new almost ever class.\n",
    "- *How often have you helped a teammate during the daily warm-up presentation?* \n",

    "### Presence Outside of Class \n",
    "\n",
    "- *How often have you attended Student Hours or Peer Help?* \n",
